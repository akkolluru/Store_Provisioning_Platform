# Load Testing

## Industry Standard Guidelines

1. **Define Clear Objectives**: Establish specific performance benchmarks and success criteria before conducting load tests. Define metrics such as response times, throughput, and error rates.

2. **Simulate Realistic Scenarios**: Create test scenarios that accurately reflect real-world usage patterns, including peak loads, typical usage, and burst traffic conditions.

3. **Gradually Increase Load**: Start with baseline loads and gradually increase to identify performance thresholds and breaking points. Monitor system behavior throughout the test.

4. **Monitor All System Components**: Track performance metrics across all system components including applications, databases, caches, and infrastructure during load tests.

5. **Analyze and Document Results**: Thoroughly analyze test results to identify bottlenecks and performance issues. Document findings and recommendations for system improvements.
