# Security Testing

## Industry Standard Guidelines

1. **Implement Shift-Left Security**: Integrate security testing early in the development lifecycle through automated security scans in CI/CD pipelines to identify vulnerabilities before deployment.

2. **Conduct Regular Penetration Testing**: Perform periodic manual and automated penetration testing to identify security weaknesses that automated tools might miss.

3. **Perform Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan application dependencies for known vulnerabilities and maintain updated software bills of materials (SBOMs) for all applications.

4. **Execute Static and Dynamic Analysis**: Use static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools to identify security flaws in code and running applications.

5. **Validate Security Controls**: Test the effectiveness of implemented security controls including authentication, authorization, encryption, and input validation mechanisms.
