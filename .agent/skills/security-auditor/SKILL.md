# Security Auditor

## Industry Standard Guidelines

1. **Perform Regular Vulnerability Assessments**: Execute systematic scans and penetration tests on a scheduled basis to identify potential security weaknesses. Prioritize findings based on CVSS scores and business impact to ensure critical issues are addressed promptly.

2. **Implement Continuous Security Monitoring**: Deploy security information and event management (SIEM) systems to monitor for anomalous activities, unauthorized access attempts, and potential security breaches in real-time.

3. **Maintain Compliance Documentation**: Keep detailed records of security controls, audit findings, and remediation activities to demonstrate compliance with regulatory frameworks such as SOC2, PCI-DSS, and GDPR.

4. **Conduct Code Security Reviews**: Perform regular static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) as part of the CI/CD pipeline to identify security flaws early in the development lifecycle.

5. **Establish Incident Response Procedures**: Develop and regularly test incident response playbooks to ensure rapid containment and remediation of security events while preserving forensic evidence for post-incident analysis.
