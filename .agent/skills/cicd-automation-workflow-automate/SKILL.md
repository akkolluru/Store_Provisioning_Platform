# CI/CD Automation

## Industry Standard Guidelines

1. **Automate Build and Test Processes**: Implement automated compilation, packaging, and testing of code changes to ensure quality and consistency. Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests in the pipeline.

2. **Implement Quality Gates**: Include automated security scanning, code quality checks, and performance tests as mandatory gates before code promotion to prevent defects from reaching production.

3. **Enable Rapid Feedback**: Provide immediate feedback to developers on build and test results. Implement notifications and dashboards to keep teams informed of pipeline status.

4. **Maintain Pipeline Reliability**: Ensure CI/CD pipelines are reliable and deterministic. Implement proper artifact management and maintain pipeline infrastructure with appropriate monitoring.

5. **Support Multiple Environments**: Design pipelines that can deploy to multiple environments (development, staging, production) with appropriate validation and approval processes.
