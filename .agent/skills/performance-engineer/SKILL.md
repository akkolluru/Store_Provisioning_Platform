# Performance Engineer

## Industry Standard Guidelines

1. **Profile and Benchmark**: Regularly profile applications to identify performance bottlenecks and establish baseline measurements. Use profiling tools to understand resource usage patterns and optimize accordingly.

2. **Optimize Resource Utilization**: Fine-tune system resources including CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage. Implement efficient algorithms and data structures to minimize resource consumption.

3. **Scale Horizontally and Vertically**: Design systems that can scale both horizontally (adding more machines) and vertically (increasing machine capacity) based on workload demands.

4. **Implement Caching Strategies**: Use appropriate caching layers at different levels (application, database, CDN) to reduce response times and decrease load on backend systems.

5. **Monitor Performance Metrics**: Continuously monitor key performance indicators and set up alerts for performance degradation. Use APM tools to gain insights into application performance.
