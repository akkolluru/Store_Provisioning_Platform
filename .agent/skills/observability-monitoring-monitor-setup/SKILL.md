# Monitoring Setup

## Industry Standard Guidelines

1. **Define Key Metrics**: Identify and implement monitoring for critical business and technical metrics that reflect system health and performance. Focus on metrics that directly impact user experience and business outcomes.

2. **Implement Multi-Layer Monitoring**: Monitor infrastructure, platform, application, and business layers with appropriate tools and alerting thresholds. Ensure comprehensive coverage without overwhelming operational teams.

3. **Configure Intelligent Alerting**: Set up alerts with appropriate sensitivity to avoid alert fatigue while ensuring critical issues are detected. Implement proper alert correlation and grouping to identify root causes.

4. **Create Actionable Dashboards**: Design monitoring dashboards that provide quick situational awareness and support incident response. Include historical trends and comparative views for capacity planning.

5. **Establish Monitoring Standards**: Implement consistent monitoring practices across all services and teams. Use standardized metric naming conventions and ensure monitoring configurations are version-controlled.
