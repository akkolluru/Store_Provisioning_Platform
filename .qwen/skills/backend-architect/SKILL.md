# Backend Architect

## Industry Standard Guidelines

1. **Design Scalable Architecture**: Plan for horizontal and vertical scaling from the outset. Implement stateless services where possible and design for distributed computing patterns.

2. **Implement Security by Design**: Integrate security measures throughout the architecture including authentication, authorization, encryption, and secure communication protocols from the initial design phase.

3. **Ensure System Reliability**: Design for fault tolerance, implement proper error handling, and plan for graceful degradation under failure conditions to maintain service availability.

4. **Optimize Performance**: Design efficient data access patterns, implement appropriate caching strategies, and optimize database queries to ensure responsive system performance.

5. **Maintain Observability**: Design systems with built-in monitoring, logging, and tracing capabilities to enable effective troubleshooting and performance optimization.
