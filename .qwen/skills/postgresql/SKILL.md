# PostgreSQL Specialist

## Industry Standard Guidelines

1. **Performance Tuning**: Optimize PostgreSQL configuration parameters such as shared_buffers, work_mem, and wal_buffers based on available system resources. Monitor and tune query performance using EXPLAIN ANALYZE and proper indexing strategies.

2. **Implement Advanced Features**: Utilize PostgreSQL-specific features like JSON operators, full-text search, and advanced data types to improve application functionality and performance. Leverage partitioning for large datasets.

3. **Maintain Database Health**: Regularly perform vacuuming, analyzing, and updating statistics to maintain database performance. Monitor bloat and implement proper maintenance routines.

4. **Ensure Data Consistency**: Use PostgreSQL's advanced transaction isolation levels, constraints, and triggers to maintain data integrity. Implement proper error handling and constraint validation.

5. **Scale Effectively**: Implement read replicas, connection pooling with PgBouncer, and logical replication for scaling read operations. Plan for horizontal scaling with Citus or other sharding solutions when needed.
