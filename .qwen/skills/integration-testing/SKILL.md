# Integration Testing

## Industry Standard Guidelines

1. **Test Component Interactions**: Validate that different system components work correctly together, including API contracts, data flow, and error handling between services.

2. **Use Realistic Test Data**: Employ realistic test data that reflects production scenarios to ensure accurate validation of system behavior under real-world conditions.

3. **Test External Dependencies**: Validate interactions with external services, databases, and third-party APIs, including proper error handling when dependencies fail.

4. **Automate Integration Tests**: Integrate comprehensive integration tests into CI/CD pipelines to catch integration issues early in the development cycle.

5. **Monitor System Behavior**: Track system performance and behavior during integration tests to identify bottlenecks and ensure system stability under integrated workloads.
