# Grafana Dashboards

## Industry Standard Guidelines

1. **Design Purpose-Driven Dashboards**: Create dashboards with specific audiences and use cases in mind. Focus on actionable information that enables quick decision-making and problem resolution.

2. **Implement Consistent Visualization**: Use consistent color schemes, panel layouts, and naming conventions across dashboards. Apply appropriate visualization types based on the data being presented.

3. **Organize Information Hierarchically**: Structure dashboards with the most critical information at the top. Group related metrics together and provide drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.

4. **Include Contextual Information**: Add annotations, thresholds, and trend indicators to provide context for metric values. Include relevant documentation and runbook links for incident response.

5. **Maintain Dashboard Quality**: Regularly review and update dashboards to ensure relevance. Remove obsolete panels and ensure all metrics are accurate and up-to-date.
