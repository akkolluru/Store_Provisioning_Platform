# Observability Engineer

## Industry Standard Guidelines

1. **Implement the Three Pillars**: Establish comprehensive logging, metrics, and distributed tracing to achieve full system visibility. Ensure all three components work together to provide complete operational insight.

2. **Instrument Applications Properly**: Add appropriate instrumentation to applications to capture meaningful business and technical metrics. Use semantic conventions for consistent metric naming and structure.

3. **Set Up Alerting Systems**: Configure intelligent alerting based on business impact and system health indicators. Implement proper alert routing, escalation policies, and noise reduction techniques.

4. **Design for Scalability**: Ensure observability systems can scale with application growth. Use appropriate sampling strategies for high-volume data like traces to balance insight with resource usage.

5. **Maintain Data Retention Policies**: Implement appropriate data retention policies based on compliance requirements and operational needs. Balance storage costs with historical analysis requirements.
