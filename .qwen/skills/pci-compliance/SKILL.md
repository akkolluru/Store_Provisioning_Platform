# PCI Compliance

## Industry Standard Guidelines

1. **Build and Maintain Secure Networks**: Implement and maintain a firewall configuration that protects cardholder data. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.

2. **Protect Cardholder Data**: Protect stored cardholder data using encryption and masking techniques. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.

3. **Maintain Vulnerability Management**: Use and regularly update antivirus software or programs. Develop and maintain secure systems and applications with regular security patches.

4. **Implement Strong Access Control**: Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know. Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access.

5. **Regularly Monitor and Test Networks**: Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data. Regularly test security systems and processes to identify vulnerabilities.
