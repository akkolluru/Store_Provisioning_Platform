# GDPR Data Handling

## Industry Standard Guidelines

1. **Implement Data Minimization**: Collect only the personal data necessary for specified purposes. Regularly review and delete data that is no longer needed for business purposes.

2. **Ensure Lawful Basis**: Establish and document a lawful basis for processing personal data. Ensure consent is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous when required.

3. **Provide Data Subject Rights**: Implement procedures to honor data subject rights including access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection to processing.

4. **Maintain Data Security**: Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, loss, or destruction. Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.

5. **Document Processing Activities**: Maintain records of processing activities and conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for high-risk processing operations.
