# Database Architect

## Industry Standard Guidelines

1. **Design for Scalability**: Plan database architecture to accommodate growth with horizontal and vertical scaling options. Implement sharding strategies when appropriate and ensure the schema supports future expansion requirements.

2. **Implement High Availability**: Design database clusters with proper replication, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery procedures. Ensure RTO and RPO requirements are met through appropriate backup and replication strategies.

3. **Optimize Performance**: Design indexes, partitioning schemes, and query structures for optimal performance. Monitor database metrics continuously and tune configurations based on workload patterns.

4. **Ensure Data Integrity**: Implement proper constraints, validation, and ACID properties to maintain data consistency. Design backup and recovery procedures to protect against data corruption.

5. **Secure Database Access**: Implement strong authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms. Use connection pooling and limit database connections to prevent resource exhaustion.
